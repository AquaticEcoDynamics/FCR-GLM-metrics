# FCR-GLM-metrics
FCR-GLMv3.3 GLM-AED simulation calibrated with PEST.

## Calibrated_models folder
This folder includes the setup of all models based on the best parameter set attained through calibration. The sims only run on Linux. The time period of the simulation is from 01-12-2016 to 31-12-2019 (calibration period). The models are run by changing directory to the folder where the model files are located (cd â€¦/FCR-GLM-metrics/Calibrated_models/Deepm*) and running the following command: ./glm+_latest/glm+.
